## Description of Project <a name="description-of-project"></a>
The Bumbling Cat Pandas team had developed a gamified web-based learning system that integrates both the virtual and physical environment that aims to instill critical problem-solving and computational thinking skills.

The system engages the students by having a game that requires them to create a route using block-based programming that would pilot a robotic car through a maze. The game further challenges the students logic skills by generating bombs that would require the students to re-evaluate their routes to move the car around the bombs.
