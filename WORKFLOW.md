# Workflow 
## The Github repo consists of four main catgories of branches 
### Master branch 
The master branch contains the finalised code that is used for Releases.

### Dev branch 
The dev branch contains the most up to date code of the development code. 

### Feature branches 
The feature branch contains the development code for each specific feature.

### Whitebox Test branch
The whitebox test branch contains the code that is used to test the development code. 

## General Workflow Guidlines 
- Always commit to the dev branch before the master branch.
- Use the apporpirate branch for the code that you are working on - E.g. Terminal code should fall under the "feauture/terminal" branch.
- Pull requests to the dev branch do not require approval unless code conflicts occur.
- No direct commits to the dev branch is allowed unless under special circumstances - E.g. Updating the README.md file. 
- Personal config files, auto-gen files, compiled binaries and large asset files shall not be pushed and tracked.
